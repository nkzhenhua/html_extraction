  <comment>All Roads Lead to ROME. ROME is a set of Atom/RSS Java utilities that make it
        easy to work in Java with most syndication formats. Today it accepts all flavors of RSS
        (0.90, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94, 1.0 and 2.0), Atom 0.3 and Atom 1.0 feeds. Rome includes
        a set of parsers and generators for the various flavors of feeds, as well as converters
        to convert from one format to another. The parsers can give you back Java objects that
        are either specific for the format you want to work with, or a generic normalized
        SyndFeed object that lets you work on with the data without bothering about the
    underlying format. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
